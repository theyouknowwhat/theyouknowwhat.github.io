  <h1>Guests</h1>
  <p>(2016-Present) My songwriting and recording project. Originally began as a 'singing band' in Seattle, I gathered a small group of friends to sing a collection of songs written about travel & the idea of 'home'. I was working as dough prepper for a pizza company in Seattle at the time & for every practice I would make a pizza or two for everyone to share. Live performance was done with only myself on acoustic guitar and three to four singers brandishing various hand percussion instruments. For a time it evolved into a four piece rock band, as recorded on some tracks on the album "am" (2022).

<h1>Wire Department</h1>
<p>(2020-2021) An electronic music project. Described by my friend <a href="https://adelbengo.bandcamp.com/album/dog-calming-music">Adel Bengo</a> as sounding like the instruments waking up & trying to play themselves. In the late twenty-teens I worked at a coffee shop with Maya McGrory and we would obsess about the idea of building a synthesizer together. I had become enthralled with synthesis after a friend paid me rent to sublet my room with an MS-20 while I was on tour. Maya was still in school, studying Physics but was beginning to collaborate on <a href="https://chanelbeads.bandcamp.com/">Chanel Beads</a> with Shane Lavers as well as writing her own music as <a href="https://colle.bandcamp.com/">Colle</a>. We would spend hours during our shifts talking about music & production & krautrock. Eventually, we finally made concrete plans. Maya had found an electronics parts store on the eastside & we drove over to Bellevue in her mom's cadillac escalade. We bought breadboards and transistors and everything else we thought we would need to build a VCO - the first piece in our crazy project. The upstairs of the store had a sign declaring the entire second level "WIRE DEPARTMENT" & much to our delight it was scattered with spools of all different types & gauges of wire. We never got further than purchasing all these parts -- I believe I still have them all in a box somewhere in storage -- but in 2020 between the beginning of the Lockdown and the beginning of the George Floyd Uprising I made a slew of electronic instrumentals. Dreaming of a better world to come, I decided to name it in honor of our unrealized dream: WIRE DEPARTMENT.
